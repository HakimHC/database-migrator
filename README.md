# SQL SERVER TO MONGODB MIGRATOR

This application uses PyODBC to get all the information from a SQL Server Database (every table, and all data they contain)
and copies all the data to a new MongoDB database.
Currently it only supports SQL Server and only with ODBC connection strings, this is the first version.
It comes with a simple GUI.
This is my first ever real github repository.
Thank you for reading.

### FIRST EVER GITHUB REPO.
